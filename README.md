# gpu-for-tensorflow
There are a lot of difficulties for Windows WSL users to run Machine Learning Projects. 

The purpose of this repo is to create notes in Markdown Files(.md) so that Windows Users can run ML projects by using GPU resources. 

The list of Markdown files are listed below: 

### 1. Installation Tensorflow on GPU Desktop
- WSL, Miniconda, verv, CUDA and cuDNN
- (NEW) [Installation steps on YT by Jeff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S81koZpwPA&ab_channel=JeffHeaton)

<hr />

### 2. Installation Tensorflow with Applications

- (New) [Install Tensorflow/Keras in WSL2 for Applications of Deep Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KinTNHO-6IY&t=316s&ab_channel=JeffHeaton)
- [Git Link](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-march-2023.ipynb)
- WSL, Miniconda, verv, CUDA and cuDNN

Steps:
- Follow steps 1, and 2. Install NVIDIA drivers and create a WSL env 
- (base)>>conda install jupyter 
- Download tool.yml file (cuda + cuDNN any other tools )

### 3. Install Pytorch on GPU with Application
